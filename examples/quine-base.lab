This is the base code for a quine using grid rotation. That is, it correctly prints
out the data itself, but the data has been replaced with "abcde" instead of the 
actual code. To generate the data for the actual quine, take the code starting with 
newline at the end of the first line, reverse that, convert each character to its 
character code, reverse that and list all of them, separated by "_", after the 
initial "<" (and remove the NOPs in the first line).
You can use the following CJam script for that:

    Sq_W%{is'_+}%\
