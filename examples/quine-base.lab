This is the base code for a quine. That is, it correctly prints out the data itself,
but the data has been replaced with "abcde" instead of the actual code. To generate
the data for the actual quine, reverse the code starting in line 28, convert each
character to its character code, and list all of them, separated by :}_, one
character per line before line 28. You can use the following CJam script for that:

    qW%{is":}_"+N*N}/
